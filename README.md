# requirement-analysis

This repository is created to explore the concept of requirement analysis in software development. 

Requirement analysis is a crucial phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) that involves identifying, documenting, and validating the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a new or modified software product. 

The purpose of this repository is to document best practices, tools, techniques, and case studies related to requirement gathering and analysis. It will serve as a resource for software engineers, business analysts, and project managers aiming to improve project outcomes through effective requirement analysis.
